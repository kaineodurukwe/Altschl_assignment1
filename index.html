            <h3>Why Alt school?</h3>
            <p>Honestly speaking, The popular x user "@hacksultan" played a major role in my decision to enroll in the Altschool programme. his constant tweets about the then ongoing registration caught my attention. And as i had been also searching for a learning forum to futher grasp the fundamentals of front-end engineering and build a solid foundation for my self, it just clicked. The few weeks i have spent enrolled under the school of engineering, have been quite enjoyable, but somewhat stressful. I look foward to spending futher time with the great tutors at Altschool. </p>
